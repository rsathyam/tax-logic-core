# Contributing to tax-logic-core

Thank you for your interest in contributing to tax-logic-core! This open-source project aims to create a transparent, auditable US federal tax calculation engine that anyone can verify and improve.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Tax calculation software should be **transparent**. When you calculate your taxes, you should be able to understand exactly how each number was derived and verify it against IRS publications. This project makes that possible.

## How Can I Contribute?

### 🐛 Report Calculation Errors

Found a calculation that doesn't match IRS publications? This is our TOP PRIORITY.

1. Open an issue with tag `[CALCULATION ERROR]`
2. Include:
   - The specific calculation or function
   - Your expected result (with IRS source)
   - Our actual result
   - A reproducible test case

### 📚 Add or Fix IRS Citations

Every calculation should cite its legal authority. Help us by:

- Adding missing citations to existing code
- Fixing incorrect citations
- Adding links to IRS publications/forms

### 🧮 Implement Missing Features

Check our [Issues](https://github.com/rsathyam/tax-logic-core/issues) for:
- `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
- `help wanted` - We need community input
- `enhancement` - Feature requests

Priority areas:
- [ ] Form 1040 Schedule A line-by-line
- [ ] EITC calculation (complex!)
- [ ] State tax calculations
- [ ] More edge cases in existing modules

### ✅ Add Test Cases

We need more test cases covering:
- Edge cases (phase-outs, limits, cliffs)
- Common taxpayer scenarios
- Unusual situations (expatriates, complex K-1s)

### 📖 Improve Documentation

- Code comments explaining tax concepts
- README improvements
- Example usage

---

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rsathyam/tax-logic-core.git
cd tax-logic-core

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

## Coding Standards

### 1. Every Function Must Have Documentation

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the taxable portion of Social Security benefits
 * 
 * LEGAL AUTHORITY: IRC §86
 * IRS REFERENCE: Publication 915, Worksheet 1
 * FORM: 1040, Line 6b
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * Up to 85% of Social Security benefits may be taxable,
 * depending on "provisional income" (AGI + tax-exempt interest + 50% of SS)
 * 
 * THRESHOLDS (Single):
 * - Below $25,000: 0% taxable
 * - $25,000 - $34,000: Up to 50% taxable
 * - Above $34,000: Up to 85% taxable
 * 
 * @param {number} benefits - Total Social Security benefits received
 * @param {number} agi - Adjusted Gross Income
 * @param {string} filingStatus - Filing status
 * @returns {number} - Taxable portion of Social Security
 */
function calculateTaxableSocialSecurity(benefits, agi, filingStatus) {
    // ... implementation
}
```

### 2. IRS Citations Are Required

For any tax calculation, include:
- IRC section (e.g., `IRC §199A`)
- IRS Publication (e.g., `Publication 535`)
- Form/Line number when applicable (e.g., `Form 8995`)
- Treasury Regulation if relevant (e.g., `Treas. Reg. §1.199A-1`)

### 3. Use Constants for Tax Parameters

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD - Easy to update annually
const STANDARD_DEDUCTION_SINGLE_2025 = 15700;

// ❌ BAD - Magic number buried in code
const deduction = income * 0.22 + 15700;
```

### 4. Handle Edge Cases Explicitly

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD - Edge cases are clear
if (income <= 0) return 0;
if (income > MAX_TAXABLE_INCOME) income = MAX_TAXABLE_INCOME;

// ❌ BAD - Unclear behavior at edges
return income * rate;
```

### 5. No Tax Advice in Code

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD - Factual, not advisory
// This calculates the potential QBI deduction under IRC §199A

// ❌ BAD - Sounds like advice
// You should take the QBI deduction to save money
```

The QBI deduction calculation returns incorrect results for SSTB income.

**Expected behavior**
Based on IRC §199A and Publication 535, the calculation should...

**Actual behavior**
The code returns $X when it should return $Y

**Test case**
```javascript
const form = {
    scheduleC: { netProfit: 100000 },
    filingStatus: 'single',
    // ... additional fields
};
// Expected QBI: $15,000
// Actual: $20,000
```

## Annual Updates

Tax law parameters change annually. If you're updating for a new tax year:

1. Update all threshold/bracket amounts
2. Update the `TAX_YEAR` constant
3. Reference the appropriate Rev. Proc. for inflation adjustments
4. Update test cases with new expected values
5. Update documentation dates
